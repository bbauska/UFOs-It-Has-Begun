## UFO's It Has Begun - Past, Present, Future - narrated by Rod Serling (1974, 1976 & 1979)

<p>This is an unofficial NASA/DOD UFO documentary from the 1970s. This film was released at least three 
times in the '70s. Originally debuting as "UFO's: Past, Present, and Future" on July 31, 1974, this 
program was later updated & re-released twice, as "UFOs: It Has Begun," in '76 & '79.</p>
<p>A few in the government wanted the truth to come out 49 years ago.  The unelected 3-letter-agencies
who run the show along with the entire US military, said "no".</p>
