# UFOs-It-Has-Begun

<h3><a href="https://youtu.be/6CJdUA8LQg0">UFO's It Has Begun - Past, Present, Future - narrated by Rod Serling (1974, 1976 & 1979)</a></h3>

<p>This is an unofficial NASA/DOD UFO documentary from 1974. This film was released at least three 
times in the '70s. Originally debuting as "UFO's: Past, Present, and Future" on July 31, 1974, this 
program was later updated & re-released twice, as "UFOs: It Has Begun," in '76 & '79.</p>
<p>A few in the government wanted the truth to come out 51 years ago.  The UN-elected 3-letter-agencies
who run the show along with the entire US military, said "no". WE are your leaders.</p>
<p>This makes me sick. The 3-letter agencies have no right. Yet they take 1/2 your taxes
and shove their beliefs up your ass. And those ignorant Americans support this BS.</p>
<p>Cowards!</p>
