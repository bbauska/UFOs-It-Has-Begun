# UFOs-It-Has-Begun

## UFO's It Has Begun - Past, Present, Future - narrated by Rod Serling (1974, 1976 & 1979)

<p>This is an unofficial NASA/DOD UFO documentary from the 1970s. This film was released at least three 
times in the '70s. Originally debuting as "UFO's: Past, Present, and Future" on July 31, 1974, this 
program was later updated & re-released twice, as "UFOs: It Has Begun," in '76 & '79.</p>
<p>A few in the government wanted the truth to come out 49 years ago.  The unelected assholes in 
charge obviously said "no".  So here, 2023, and scum still runs the show.  Pure profit-driven
scum.</p>
